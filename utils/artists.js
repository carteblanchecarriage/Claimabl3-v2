            description: "Anthony is a Denver based artist and community leader. His public art style often references South Western textiles, colors and shapes. His use of contrast creates movement and energy. This building was painted to shed light on an issue that has been swept underneath the rug. The city and the stock show took this home from the residents through eminent domain. Originally they told all of them that they were going to knock them down. Then after they got the people out, they (city and stock show) designated the ones we see still standing as “historic” and would be saved for future campus development. This obviously upset the former owners who both felt hard done by what they got paid and slapped in the face because they didn’t have to leave if they weren’t going to knock them down. I partnered with @gescoalition on this project. This mural is meant to bring back a little bit of life to these homes and as a reminder that we are still here in the community and are willing to stand for each other.",
